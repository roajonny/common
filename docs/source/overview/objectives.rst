Objectives
==========

This documentation was organized with the following objectives in mind, to the
benefit of the reader:

#. To illustrate an example template for project documentation/requirements
   management, generated directly from this repository's source code
#. To outline the pre-requisite knowledge required to leverage this template,
   and to streamline the learning process
#. To detail a scalable git branching methodology for effective collaboration,
   applied to a workflow which aims to overcome the user-unfriendliness of FPGA
   synthesis tools

Ideally, after going through the process, **one would have everything they need
to spin this off for their own projects.**

Let's take a look at a :doc:`../project/synopsis` of the example project.
