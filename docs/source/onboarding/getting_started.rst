Getting Started
===============

Confirm the `Python Virtual Environment <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#what-is-a-python-virtual-environment>`_
is active - you should see ``(.venv)`` next to your username on the command line:

|

.. figure:: ./images/venv_confirmation.png

   *Virtual environment is active*

|

If you don't see it, navigate to where you cloned the repository and source the
``init_venv.sh`` bash script:

|

.. figure:: ./images/venv_script.png

   *Location of environment initialization script*

|

.. note::

   The script takes care of the virtual environment setup, and installs
   package dependencies for all the tools mentioned throughout this example
   documentation, so you can just focus on tutorials and effectively skip any
   steps that ask you to run ``pip install`` or modify the ``conf.py``.
