Tools Used
==========

This documentation is rendered using `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, which is a Python-based
documentation generator that takes plain-text source files in `reStructuredText
(RST) <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ to
produce various output formats (this example uses HTML).

Additionally, Sphinx is extensible by other Python packages to expand it's
functionality - these tools are summarized below:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

     - Description
   * - `Sphinx-Needs <https://www.sphinx-needs.com/>`_
     - Requirements lifecycle management
   * - `Mermaid <https://mermaid.js.org/intro/>`_
     - Diagrams and charting
   * - `Wavedrom <https://wavedrom.com/>`_
     - Digital timing diagrams

Additionally `Visio
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software>`_ can
used for anything more complex than can be done in Mermaid, as Visio diagrams
can be embedded as .png files.
