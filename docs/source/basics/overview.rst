Overview
========

This document was fundamentally organized to accomplish the following things,
to the benefit of the reader:

#. Illustrate a template of an example project's documentation and requirements management
#. Outline the pre-requisite knowledge required to leverage/modify this template
#. Detail the git branching methodology and workflow for meaningful collaboration
#. Streamline the learning process by outlining a sequence of useful tutorials

Ideally, after going through everything, **one would have everything they need
to spin this off for their own projects.**

Let's take a look at a :doc:`../project/synopsis` of the example project.
