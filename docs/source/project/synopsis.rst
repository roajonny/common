**The Synopsis section is where a very high-level overview of the project can be written, to
give context to those being onboarded to the project**

The client is working on a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testbed application for
satellite avionics that require an FPGA on their custom test hardware to
communicate with their Flat-Sat UUT.

They've already developed and verified this custom hardware, and need design
engineers to implement the logic needed to stimulate the high-reliability
bespoke interfaces.
