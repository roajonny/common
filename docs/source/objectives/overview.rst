Overview
========

This document was fundamentally organized with the following objectives in mind:

#. Illustrate an example template for project documentation/requirements
   management, generated directly from source code using Sphinx and
   Sphinx-Needs
#. Outline the pre-requisite knowledge required to leverage or modify the template
#. Detail a scalable git branching methodology and workflow for meaningful and
   efficient collaboration
#. Streamline the learning process by outlining a sensible progression of tasks

Ideally, after going through the process, **one would have everything they need
to spin this off for their own projects.**

Let's take a look at a :doc:`../project/synopsis` of the example project.
